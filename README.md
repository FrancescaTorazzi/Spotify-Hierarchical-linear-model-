This dataset contains 3362 obs regarding the songs listened to by 8 people, using the Spotify application. 
We created the dataset by asking some friends to download their personal data from Spotify and shared it with us.
To understand the impact of various song characteristics on the listening duration (minutes played) across different individuals and to determine 
which song features most significantly influence listening behavior.
Hence, we want to model the relationship between song characteristics (predictors) and the min Played (response variable), 
while accounting for the variability across different individuals (groups).
